# Project Map

A Project Map is a versioned, machine-readable definition of a project's foundations and capabilities. It records intended outcomes, coverage, dependencies, and links to feature documents without embedding mutable execution state.

The conventional artifact path is `openspec/project-map.json`. Version 1 uses `"gentle-shell.project-map/v1"`.

## Fields

```ts
{
	version: "gentle-shell.project-map/v1";
	project: { id: string; name: string };
	foundations?: Array<{
		id: string;
		outcome: string;
		state: ProjectMapState;
		evidence?: string[];
	}>;
	capabilities: Array<{
		id: string;
		outcome: string;
		foundationRefs?: string[];
		dependsOn?: string[];
		contracts?: string[];
		featureDocs?: string[];
		surfaces: ProjectMapSurface[];
		state: ProjectMapState;
	}>;
}
```

`version`, `project`, `project.id`, `project.name`, `capabilities`, and every capability's `id`, `outcome`, `surfaces`, and `state` are required. Foundations, `foundationRefs`, `dependsOn`, `contracts`, and `featureDocs` default to empty arrays. `evidence` is optional.

Identifiers are lowercase kebab-case (`/^[a-z0-9]+(?:-[a-z0-9]+)*$/`) and no longer than 64 characters. Foundation and capability identifiers have independent namespaces. Identifiers must be unique within their namespace.

## Vocabulary

Lifecycle states, in their frozen v1 order:

- `done`
- `active`
- `review`
- `ready`
- `blocked`
- `planned`

Coverage surfaces, in their frozen v1 order:

- `productUx`
- `web`
- `api`
- `data`
- `security`
- `operations`
- `tests`

A capability must cover at least one surface and cannot repeat a surface. String-reference arrays cannot contain empty or duplicate entries. `foundationRefs` must resolve to a foundation, and `dependsOn` must resolve to a capability with no dependency cycle; each cyclic dependency group is reported once. Its diagnostic names every member of the group alongside one observed path inside it. That path is a witness for the group, so validate a repair by re-running validation rather than trusting the named path alone. `contracts` entries are structural in v1 and are not resolved.

## Feature-document references

`featureDocs` entries are repository-relative paths. POSIX absolute paths, Windows drive paths, Windows UNC paths, rooted backslash paths, and paths containing a `..` segment are rejected before any filesystem access. A caller may provide a document-existence callback. Missing documents are errors by default, or warnings when `strictFeatureDocs: false` is selected.

## Canonical form

A valid map is canonicalized before it is returned or serialized, so the serialized bytes are independent of input key order. Root keys are ordered as `version`, `project`, `foundations`, `capabilities`; project keys as `id`, `name`; foundation keys as `id`, `outcome`, `state`, `evidence`; and capability keys as `id`, `outcome`, `foundationRefs`, `dependsOn`, `contracts`, `featureDocs`, `surfaces`, `state`. Foundations and capabilities sort by identifier. Coverage surfaces use the frozen surface order. `foundationRefs`, `dependsOn`, `contracts`, `featureDocs`, and foundation `evidence` sort lexicographically.

`validateProjectMap`, `parseProjectMap`, and `readProjectMapFile` never throw and form the malformed-input boundary. `canonicalizeProjectMap` and `serializeProjectMap` require an already valid `ProjectMapV1`.

Serialization is exactly:

```ts
`${JSON.stringify(canonicalizeProjectMap(map), null, 2)}\n`
```

## Forbidden runtime fields

The versioned artifact must not contain mutable runtime-coordination fields. These fields are forbidden at every object level:

`session`, `sessionId`, `session_id`, `worktree`, `branch`, `lease`, `leases`, `heartbeat`, `heartbeats`, `claim`, `claims`, `blockers`, and `generation`.

## Diagnostics

| Code | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| `project-map/unsupported-schema-version` | `version` is a string other than the frozen v1 version. |
| `project-map/unknown-field` | An object contains a key outside its documented contract. |
| `project-map/forbidden-runtime-field` | An object contains a forbidden runtime-coordination field. |
| `project-map/missing-field` | A required field is absent. |
| `project-map/invalid-field` | A value has the wrong type, fails its field rules, duplicates an array entry, or uses an unsafe feature-document path. |
| `project-map/duplicate-id` | A foundation or capability repeats an identifier in its own namespace. |
| `project-map/unknown-reference` | A foundation or capability dependency reference cannot be resolved. |
| `project-map/dependency-cycle` | Capability dependencies contain a cycle. |
| `project-map/missing-feature-document` | The supplied existence callback cannot find a referenced feature document. |
| `project-map/invalid-json` | Project Map text cannot be parsed as JSON. |
| `project-map/unreadable-artifact` | The Project Map artifact cannot be read from disk. |
